* Summary

All Python code blocks from DEPENDENCIES.org have been tested and validated on Linux (aarch64).

** Results
- Total blocks tested: 17
- Passed: 17
- Failed: 0
- Success rate: 100%

* Test Results by Category

** AWS Integration ✓
- =boto3=: Successfully created Bedrock client with LocalStack endpoint
- =awscli-local=: Successfully executed awslocal commands

** LangChain Ecosystem ✓
- =langchain=: Document splitting working correctly
- =langchain-aws=: BedrockEmbeddings imported successfully
- =langchain-community=: All community integrations available

** Machine Learning & Embeddings ✓
- =sentence-transformers=: Generated 384-dimension embeddings
- =faiss-cpu=: Vector search with 1000 vectors successful
- =spacy=: Imported successfully (model download separate)

** Data Processing ✓
- =pandas=: DataFrame operations working
- =numpy=: Vector math and cosine similarity calculations correct

** Database & Storage ✓
- =sqlalchemy=: ORM and in-memory SQLite working
- =PyPDF2=: PDF capabilities available

** Search & Ranking ✓
- =rank-bm25=: BM25 search working with correct ranking
- =rouge=: Text similarity metrics calculated

** Configuration & Validation ✓
- =pydantic=: Model validation working (note: using V1 validators)
- =python-dotenv=: Environment variable loading successful

** Visualization ✓
- =plotly=: Figure creation successful

* Deprecation Warnings

Two minor warnings were noted:
1. SQLAlchemy: =declarative_base()= should use =sqlalchemy.orm.declarative_base()=
2. Pydantic: V1 style =@validator= should migrate to V2 =@field_validator=

These don't affect functionality but should be updated for future compatibility.

* Environment Details

#+begin_src text
Platform: Linux (aarch64)
Python: 3.11.2
Virtual Environment: uv-managed .venv
LocalStack: Running and accessible
#+end_src

* Emacs Execution

To execute these blocks in Emacs:

1. Open DEPENDENCIES.org in Emacs
2. For individual blocks: =C-c C-c= on the block
3. For all blocks: =M-x org-babel-execute-buffer=

Note: The =:session deps= header arg creates a persistent Python session for state sharing between blocks.

* Conclusion

The DEPENDENCIES.org file serves as both documentation and executable validation. All dependencies are properly installed and functional on this Linux ARM64 environment, confirming Level 1 compatibility.
