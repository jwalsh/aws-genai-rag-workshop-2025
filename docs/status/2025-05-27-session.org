* Session Summary

Today's session focused on continuing the AWS GenAI RAG Workshop preparation after running out of context in the previous session. Key accomplishments included resolving repository synchronization issues and running code quality checks.

* Completed Tasks

** 1. Repository Synchronization
- Fixed divergent branches by rebasing local changes with remote
- Successfully pushed pyproject.toml dependency fixes (commit: a84c6ca)
  - Updated README reference for hatchling compatibility
  - Added missing dependencies: rank-bm25, rouge, spacy
  - Added hatch build configuration

** 2. Code Quality Improvements
- Installed and ran ruff linter on the codebase
- Fixed 237 linting issues automatically (commit: 9d72c27)
  - Import sorting and formatting
  - Updated type annotations to modern Python syntax
  - Removed trailing whitespace and blank lines
  - Fixed unused variables
  - Applied style improvements
- 4 issues remain requiring manual intervention:
  - ClassVar annotations for mutable class attributes
  - Combining nested with statements

** 3. Environment Challenges
- Encountered timeout issues with package installation via make commands
- Successfully worked around by using uv directly for targeted installations
- Virtual environment appears to be incomplete (missing pip)
