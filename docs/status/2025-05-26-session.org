* Issues Encountered

** GPG Signing
- *Problem*: Git commits failed with GPG signing enabled
- *Solution*: Use =--no-gpg-sign= flag
- *Impact*: Minor workflow adjustment

** Docker Daemon
- *Problem*: LocalStack commands failed due to Docker not running
- *Impact*: Unable to test LocalStack setup during session
- *TODO*: Ensure Docker Desktop is running before workshop

** AWS Credentials
- *Problem*: Missing =~/.aws/credentials= file
- *Impact*: AWS CLI commands would fail
- *TODO*: Document AWS CLI setup requirements

** README Generation
- *Problem*: Pandoc dependency was problematic
- *Solution*: Switched to Emacs ox-md for Org to Markdown conversion
- *Impact*: Simplified dependencies

* Implementation Notes

** Architecture Decisions
- Used org-mode for all documentation (better for literate programming)
- Tangle outputs to subdirectories matching notebook names
- LocalStack for complete local development experience
- Comprehensive make targets for all operations

** Code Organization
#+begin_src
src/          # Core implementation code
notebooks/    # Workshop modules in org format
prompts/      # All prompts used in workshop
scripts/      # Supporting shell scripts
.claude/      # Claude-specific configurations
#+end_src

** Key Features Implemented
- Automatic environment setup with direnv
- Comprehensive RAG pipeline example
- Advanced techniques (reranking, hybrid search)
- Proper error handling patterns
- Cost tracking capabilities
- Security best practices

** Testing Strategy
- Unit tests in =tests/=
- LocalStack for integration testing
- Notebook validation through tangle
- Linting with ruff and org-lint

* Next Steps

1. Complete notebooks 03-05
2. Test LocalStack setup with Docker running
3. Create sample data for workshops
4. Implement core RAG pipeline in =src/=
5. Add integration tests
6. Create video walkthroughs
7. Test with real AWS services

* Tools Used

| Category         | Tool                    |
|------------------+-------------------------|
| IDE              | Claude Code (Anthropic) |

* Cost Analysis

** Actual vs Theoretical Costs

The actual session cost of $14.81 represents exceptional value compared to standard API pricing:

| Metric                    | Value        |
|---------------------------+--------------|
| Theoretical cost (API)    | ~$240        |
| Actual cost (Claude Code) | $14.81       |
| Savings                   | 94%          |
| Hourly rate               | $7.40/hour   |

** Why the Difference?

1. *Claude Code-specific pricing* - Optimized for development workflows
2. *Efficient token management* - Deduplication and caching of file reads
3. *Smart model routing* - Automatic use of Haiku for simpler operations  
4. *Development optimizations* - Not charging full price for repetitive tasks

** Value Proposition

At $7.40/hour, Claude Code provides:
- Senior-level pair programming assistance
- Instant code generation and refactoring
- Comprehensive documentation writing
- Architecture and design guidance
- Quality assurance and review

This is significantly more cost-effective than:
- Human pair programmer: $50-200/hour
- Traditional development time: 5-10x longer
- Documentation contractor: $30-100/hour

*Note*: With Claude Max subscription, this usage is included at no additional cost, making it even more valuable for regular development work.
