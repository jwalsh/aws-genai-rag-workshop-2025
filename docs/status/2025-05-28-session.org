#+TITLE: AWS GenAI RAG Workshop - Development Session Status
#+AUTHOR: aygp-dr
#+DATE: 2025-05-28

* Session Summary

Today's session focused on architectural improvements, multi-OS compatibility, and adding philosophical texts to create an unconventional RAG demonstration.

* Major Accomplishments

** 1. Code Architecture Refactoring
- Removed all =:tangle= directives from notebooks that created files in =src/=
- Notebooks now import from existing =src/= modules instead of duplicating code
- This prevents code duplication and maintains single source of truth

** 2. Multi-OS Testing Framework
Created progressive capability levels for different environments:

#+begin_src text
Level 1: Python-only (FreeBSD, Linux, macOS)
Level 2: + PostgreSQL (Linux, macOS)  
Level 3: + LocalStack (Linux, macOS)
Level 4: + Real AWS (macOS primary)
#+end_src

- Created =test_compatibility.py= for Level 1 verification
- Added make targets: =test-level1= through =test-level4=
- Fixed import issues in compatibility tests

** 3. AWS Configuration Management
- Fixed AWS credentials parsing error on macOS
- Created =scripts/check-env.py= for environment detection
- Added make targets for switching between LocalStack and AWS

** 4. Philosophical RAG Demo ("Trolling Collection")
Added texts "nobody wants in their RAG":
- Boethius: =Consolation of Philosophy= (medieval)
- Kant: =Critique of Pure Reason= (enlightenment)
- Wittgenstein: =Philosophical Grammar= (modern)
- Roget's Thesaurus (for semantic bridging)

Created =src/demos/philosophical_rag.py= to demonstrate cross-document concept connections.

* Files Modified/Created

** New Files
- =WIP.org= - Multi-OS testing documentation
- =test_compatibility.py= - Python-only compatibility test
- =scripts/check-env.py= - AWS environment detection
- =scripts/fix-aws-config.py= - AWS config repair utility
- =src/demos/philosophical_rag.py= - Philosophical RAG demo
- =src/demos/__init__.py= - Package initialization

** Modified Files
- All notebooks (removed =:tangle= directives)
- =Makefile= (added OS testing targets, philosophical downloads)
- =src/utils/cost_calculator.py= (fixed class naming)
- =test_compatibility.py= (fixed imports)

* Testing Results

** Linux (Raspberry Pi ARM64) - Current Session
#+begin_src text
âœ… Level 1 (Python-only): PASSED
- Compatibility test: 10/10 tests pass
- Simple RAG pipeline: Working
- Embeddings: Dimension 384
- Cost calculation: Working
- LocalStack: Connected (3 buckets)
#+end_src

** Pending Tests
- [ ] FreeBSD 14.2 - Level 1 only
- [ ] macOS M1 - Levels 1-4
- [ ] Raspberry Pi via Tailscale - Levels 1-2

* Key Decisions

1. **No Code Tangling**: Notebooks should import, not generate source files
2. **Progressive Compatibility**: Not all environments need full AWS support
3. **Make-Based Workflow**: Reference make commands instead of duplicating scripts
4. **Philosophical Texts**: Demonstrate RAG with challenging, dense academic texts

* Next Steps

1. Test Level 1 on FreeBSD environment
2. Complete AWS profile setup on macOS
3. Run full workshop progression (Levels 1-4) on macOS
4. Document any FreeBSD-specific limitations

* Lessons Learned

- Using =uv= for dependency management provides better cross-platform compatibility
- Progressive capability levels allow workshop to run in limited environments
- Philosophical texts create interesting RAG challenges due to:
  - Dense, complex language
  - Abstract concepts
  - Cross-era terminology differences
  - Need for semantic bridging via thesaurus
