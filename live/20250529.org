** 08:39 Setup and Registration

- looks like new campus
- original build somewhere around 2022? 

** 08:56 Core setup

- look at the core setup 
- wifi 
- parkings 

** Agenda 

- OpenSearch 
- Glue 
- Athena 

Most of these should be standard for the core setup used by most of the core systems 

- The genai systems seems to be related to the standard ai models. some of the 

** 09:12 Components 

- mostly just looking at the core models 
- validate with some of the core setup
- use the test chat / claude instance from the remote

** Questions about AWS Offereings 

- ask about privacy / vpc / fine tuning
- data usage 
- some questions about the use of rag vs. fine tuning 

- noted the domain specific information 
- considered some of the cost questoins about 

** Tasks 

- build out the work on the terrraform infrastrcture for the build 

** Environment 

- looking at using sagemenaker with notebooks as the baseline for the system 
- some general backgroudn for 

** Covering the standard workflow with bedrock 

- vector embeddiings: 
- look at the core offerings not with pg + vectors 

** Indexing and Embdeeding Factors 

- fixed size 
- hierarchy 
- semantic 
- custom

...apply this to the current test

** Considerations 

- look at the 

** Strucured and Unstructured 

- unsure of the workflow that is being advocated for trying to stitch together data fro msomething like structured data / apis.

  - "train the agent" with the right tags


- using RAG to agents ? 

- unclear what the workflow for this should actually be 

** Agents 

- look at the agentic workflows since people seem to care about that 

** Walking back to core use cases 

- trying to show indexsing to nlp to sematic search 

** Indexing 

- review the indexing algorithm

** prompt routers 

- look at dspy and large model routing 
- consider the 3.5 / 3.7 / 4 router and use in other models 
- creae a mock router for the ollama calls 

** feedback and questions 

- finally got my Spark feedback 
- complaints about the nature of search, indexing, classifying documents, etc 

** Continued discussion about when people want to fine tune vs. rag 

- list on the weeks on 
chenking algorighm,
chunk size 
embedding 
vectors 
rebuilding 
indexing

** Setup

- confirm that the core notebooks are created 
- look at that collections for opoen search 

https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=us-east-2#/



** Notebook 1.1 is the core setup 

- sagementker studio 

- openseearch service 

** Structure and Clarification 

- almost not concept 
- the terminology shouldn't be used by anyone in practice 
- the use caes and chunking and questions 
- the top data being return is nonsense 
- the core of the sessions don't work as expected 
- looks like the sessions were barely tested

** DSL and complexity 

- a number of options are noted here for simplifying 

** RAG evaluation 

- take a look at returned values for the rag as generated 
- confirm the statistical and llm based matrics
  
** Prompt Gallery 

- not sure if this is that useful 
- even the core data structure to the abstraction / dsl for prompts doens't really help
