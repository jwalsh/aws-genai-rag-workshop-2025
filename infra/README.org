#+TITLE: AWS GenAI RAG Workshop Infrastructure
#+AUTHOR: aygp-dr
#+DATE: 2025-05-29
#+PROPERTY: header-args :mkdirp yes

* Overview

This infrastructure setup provides a multi-region deployment for the AWS GenAI RAG Workshop with:
- Primary region (us-east-1) for AWS Bedrock services
- Secondary region (us-west-2) for new Anthropic Claude 4 models
- Complete RAG infrastructure including OpenSearch, S3, DynamoDB, and SQS

* Architecture

** Multi-Region Design
- US-East-1: Bedrock runtime with Claude 3 models
- US-West-2: New Anthropic Claude 4 models via Bedrock
- Cross-region replication for S3 and DynamoDB
- VPC peering for secure inter-region communication

** Core Components
1. Networking: VPCs, subnets, NAT gateways, VPC endpoints
2. Bedrock: Model access and configuration for us-east-1
3. Anthropic: Enhanced model access for us-west-2
4. RAG Infrastructure: OpenSearch, S3, DynamoDB, SQS

* Deployment

** Prerequisites
#+begin_src bash
# Install Terraform
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
#+end_src

** Deploy Infrastructure
#+begin_src bash
# Deploy to dev environment
./scripts/deploy.sh dev plan
./scripts/deploy.sh dev apply

# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy.sh staging plan
./scripts/deploy.sh staging apply

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh prod plan
./scripts/deploy.sh prod apply
#+end_src

* Environment Configuration

** Development
- Minimal resources (2 AZs)
- Basic model selection
- No cross-region replication

** Staging
- Full 3 AZ deployment
- Complete model selection
- Cross-region replication enabled

** Production
- Full 3 AZ deployment
- All available models
- Cross-region replication
- Enhanced monitoring

* Terraform Modules

** Networking Module
Creates VPC infrastructure with:
- Public and private subnets
- NAT gateways for outbound connectivity
- VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Security groups

** Bedrock Module (us-east-1)
Configures:
- IAM roles and policies
- Model access parameters
- CloudWatch logging
- S3 bucket for data

** Anthropic Module (us-west-2)
Provides:
- Enhanced model access
- Lambda proxy for API compatibility
- IAM roles and policies
- S3 bucket for data

** RAG Module
Implements:
- OpenSearch domain for vector search
- S3 buckets with cross-region replication
- DynamoDB tables for metadata
- SQS queues for processing

* Cost Optimization

** Dev Environment
- t3.small instances
- Minimal redundancy
- On-demand pricing

** Staging/Production
- Reserved instances recommended
- Auto-scaling enabled
- Cost allocation tags

* Security Best Practices

1. All data encrypted at rest
2. TLS in transit
3. VPC endpoints for AWS services
4. IAM roles with least privilege
5. Security groups with minimal access
6. CloudWatch logging enabled

* Monitoring

- CloudWatch dashboards per environment
- Log aggregation to CloudWatch Logs
- Metrics for all services
- Alarms for critical thresholds

* Cleanup

#+begin_src bash
# Destroy infrastructure
./scripts/deploy.sh dev destroy
