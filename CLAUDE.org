** Architecture Overview

This is an AWS GenAI RAG Workshop that demonstrates various RAG patterns using AWS services (via LocalStack for local development).

*** Core Components

**** RAG Pipeline (=src/rag/pipeline.py=)
- Orchestrates document processing, embedding, storage, and retrieval
- Uses DynamoDB for metadata and S3 for document/embedding storage
- Supports multiple chunking strategies and embedding models

**** Key Classes
- =DocumentChunker=: Splits documents (default: 512 chars, 50 overlap)
- =EmbeddingGenerator=: Creates embeddings via Bedrock or sentence-transformers
- =VectorRetriever=: FAISS-based retrieval with optional reranking
- =SQLAgent=: Natural language to SQL conversion using Bedrock

**** AWS Services Used
- S3: Document and embedding storage
- DynamoDB: Vector metadata with GSI for doc_type queries
- Bedrock: LLMs (Claude, Titan) and embeddings
- SageMaker: Fine-tuning support
- PostgreSQL: Sample database for SQL agent

*** Workshop Structure

The workshop consists of 5 progressive modules in =notebooks/=:
1. *01_rag_basics.org*: Introduction to RAG concepts
2. *02_advanced_rag.org*: Reranking, hybrid search, evaluation
3. *03_text_to_sql.org*: Natural language database queries
4. *04_fine_tuning.org*: Model customization with SageMaker
5. *05_cost_analysis.org*: AWS cost optimization strategies

*** LocalStack Configuration

LocalStack runs on port 4566 with these pre-configured resources:
- S3 buckets: workshop-rag-documents, workshop-embeddings, workshop-model-artifacts
- DynamoDB table: workshop-vector-metadata
- PostgreSQL database: workshop_db (port 5432)

** Testing Guidelines

- Tests are in =tests/= directory
- Run individual tests: =pytest tests/test_rag.py::test_specific_function=
- Mock AWS services using moto or LocalStack endpoints
- Test data should use the sample-data directory
