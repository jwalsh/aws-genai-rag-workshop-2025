* The Challenge We Face

** Customer Pain Points

* Bonus: Stress Testing with Philosophy

** If It Can Handle Kant, It Can Handle Your Docs

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- Tested RAG on *Kant's Critique of Pure Reason* (1781)
- *Wittgenstein's Philosophical Grammar* (dense academic PDFs)
- *Roget's Thesaurus* (1852) - complex categorizations
- Medieval Latin mixed with Middle English (Boethius, 524 AD)

#+BEGIN_CENTER
*"If we can handle Kant's Critique of Pure Reason,*
*we can definitely handle your product documentation!"*
#+END_CENTER

** What This Demonstrates

- RAG handles *dense, complex language* across centuries
- Finds connections between *disparate concepts* (e.g., "perspicuity" → clarity)
- Works with *poorly formatted PDFs* and inconsistent text
- Maintains accuracy with *domain-specific terminology*

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Quick amusing demo if time permits. Shows robustness of the system.
Product managers often worry their docs are "too messy" - this proves otherwise.
